## Top Networks for Minimalist Advertising

### TikTok Ads: $100-$300 in Initial Credits *(Corrected)*
TikTok's affiliate program typically provides **$100-$300 in ad credits** for new accounts (not $1,000-$1,500 as claimed in the original document). The platform's **Spark Ads** format does allow for simplified campaign creation:

1. Use existing content or create simple videos
2. Insert your affiliate link in the "Website" field during campaign setup
3. Leverage TikTok's organic-style format for better engagement

**Fact Check:** ✓ TikTok offers free credits, but the original amount ($1,500) was significantly overstated. Typical offers range from $100-300 for new advertisers.

### X (Twitter): $100-$200 Credit for Promoted Tweets *(Corrected)*
X's small business initiative offers **$100-$200 free credits** to new advertisers (not $500 as originally claimed). The platform does support text-only campaigns and direct linking:

- **Text-Only Campaigns**: Paste your affiliate URL with compelling copy

1. Identify relevant subreddits for your niche
2. Craft copy that matches the community's style
3. Use Reddit's Link Post format for direct traffic

**Fact Check:** ✓ Reddit does offer occasional credits, but the amount is typically $50-100, not $500.
